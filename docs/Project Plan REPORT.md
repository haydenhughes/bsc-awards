# Project plan REPORT

So bsc-awards is a project to simplify the process of awards night at Bellarine
Secondary Collage. The items in scope of the project include attendance management which includes
printable year level attendance sheets, allows marking of attendance which displays the student
name and form group and only managing students which are attending, as well as a responsive gui 
for presenting the awards on any device.


## How well did the plan help with the project?
The initial plan was quite complete so it helped greatly with organising my ideas
and knowing what task to complete and when. The project plan with it's changes
continued to help the project to ensure that the tasks were being completed on time
and as a easy way to see that when a change is made to a task how the change affects
the future tasks. This made it easier to manage how much time can be allocated to a task.


## Changes

### Stage: Analysis, Task: Data Collection, Modification Date: 3/5/18
The Data Collection task had to be lengthened to roll over into the next week.
The change was caused by me not being able to meet the client inside the time marked
for Data Collection due to their schedule.

The change to the Data Collection task effected the constraints of the solution and
scope of the solution to be lengthened with the task as the data acquired from the Data Collection
task was required for those tasks even though the tasks were parallel. The Context Diagram, 
DFD and UCD tasks were forced to be shortened as they also required the data from the Data Collection task.
If the Context Diagram, DFD and UCD tasks were not shortened then the design stage would have been
effected and they needed all the time I could get for that stage.

### Stage: Development, Task Setup Dev Environment, Modification Date: 3/5/18
I created a new task as part of development stage unlike the rest of he development stage it in 
parallel to the design and analysis stages. It was created because I realised that it would be
really helpful if I could start developing with the base environment file structure and packaging and git systems
already setup, so that includes the docker image and gitlab repo. 

The creation of the Setup Dev Environment task didn't impact on any of the other tasks or project as a whole.

### Stage: Design, Task: Algorithms, Modification Date: 18/5/18
The Algorithms task was extended to as I was busy with other more important tasks at the time
and didn't complete the algorithms task in the time allocated.

This didn't affect any other tasks or the project as a whole.
